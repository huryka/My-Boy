# My-Boy
Tool for manipulating video in creative ways using multichannel audio.

Uses the `polybuffer~` object to extract amplitude data from multichannel audio, and distribute said data per-channel. In this case, it's being used to manipulate Vizzie input, i.e. video content. Drag a video in, import a folder of 5 audio files, and go nuts. Use `past` and `line` objects in succession to make easy amplitude triggers.

A significantly scrappier version of this program was used to make the visuals for Tiger Beach's "My Boy" https://www.instagram.com/p/CLHQFKJnZeH/ (hence the patch's name)
