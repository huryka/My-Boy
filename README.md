# My-Boy
Uses the `polybuffer~` object to extract amplitude data from a folder of multiple audio files, and distribute said data per-file. In this case, it's being used to manipulate Vizzie input, i.e. video content. Drag a video in, import a folder of up to 5 audio files, and go nuts. Insert `past` and `line` objects in succession to make easy amplitude triggers.

A significantly scrappier version of this program was used to make the visuals for Tiger Beach's "My Boy" https://www.instagram.com/p/CLHQFKJnZeH/ (hence the patch's name). It was eventually used live too! USB Rock Band microphone right in front of the kick drum with a projector. Good times.
